    I plan to go into more depth on this page about each of my projects. They're
    listed in reverse chronological order. In the future this page might become many,
    but for now, it will just be a scrolling archive of projects I've worked on.
    <div class="subtitle">Diving Sheets (Svelte)</div>
    Something I made over the summer to fill an immediate need. It took me like 3
    days, but it's probably one of the most useful things I've ever made.

    The thing that I did my senior year. It never got hosted, RIP.

    <div class="subtitle">Disney Trip Website (PHP)</div>
    I worked on this project in my junior year of high school. My school's capstone
    course curriculum consisted mostly of creating a website for the school. First,
    we had to find someone in the school that needed a website for "school" purposes.
    We had a few options: a guidance appointment scheduling system; a polling site
    for senior superlatives (most likely to xyz); or a site to help organize and
    deliver information about the senior trip to Disney World.
    <br /><br />
    I hope it is obvious why we chose the last one.
    <br /><br />
    After deciding on our project, we interviewed people who were involved in the
    Disney trip to understand the scope of the task we were taking on. This interview
    process allowed us to understand more about our end users, so that we could make
    a site that was more suited to them.
    <br />
    <br />
    The next part of our task was design, for this, the class split into two groups,
    and offered two competing designs. The better of the two was chosen and we moved
    on to fleshing out the site's functionality which involved student permission
    and medical information forms, student balance tracking, and a payment system
    via PayPal, and a roommate system. In addition to this, we built an analytics
    page, and a system for allowing the trip coordinators to update and view all
    of the information. All of this was kept behind a sign in screen with Google's
    oAuth API. While this list isn't exhaustive, I think it accurately covers the
    bulk of the work that we did.
    <br />
    <br />
    Once the site functionality was built out, we spent a few weeks testing and tweaking
    before delivering our final presentation to the trip coordinators, and school
    administrative staff.
    <br /><br />
    The next year, my class got to make use of the site. It seemed to be going great,
    until COVID hit, and our trip got canceled...
    <br /><br />
    The most important thing that I took away from this experience was, well, the
    experience. Working in a large group environment and managing work between multiple
    people is something that you just need to learn by doing.
