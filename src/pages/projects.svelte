    I plan to go into more depth on this page about each of my projects. They're
    listed in reverse chronological order. In the future this page might become many,
    but for now, it will just be a scrolling archive of projects I've worked on.
    <div class="subtitle">Diving Sheets (Svelte)</div>
    Something I made over the summer to fill an immediate need. It took me like 3
    days, but it's probably one of the most useful things I've ever made.

    <div class="subtitle">PW Poll (MERN stack)</div>
    The thing that I did my senior year. It never got hosted, RIP.

    <div class="subtitle">Disney Trip Website (PHP)</div>
    I worked on this project in my junior year of high school. My school's capstone
    course curriculum consisted mostly of creating a website for the school. First,
    we had to find someone in the school that needed a website for "school" purposes.
    We had a few options: a guidance appointment scheduling system; a polling site
    for senior superlatives (most likely to xyz); or a site to help organize and
    deliver information about the senior trip to Disney World.
    <br /><br />
    I hope it is obvious why we chose the last one.
    <br /><br />
    After deciding on our project, we interviewed people who were involved in the
    Disney trip to understand the scope of the task we were taking on.
