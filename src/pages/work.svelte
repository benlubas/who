    I worked at Wayfair as a software engineer. This job was a co-op that ran from
    December 10th to June 24th. I was a part of SEO Pod on the Impression team. The
    Impressions team at Wayfair solves a lot of different and interesting problems,
    and they do so using a lot of different technologies. This is perfect for me
    &mdash; a student that's trying to learn as much as possible. During the 6 
    months that I worked at Wayfair, there was always something new for me to 
    learn.

    <br />

    Here is a list of technologies that I gained experience with at Wayfair:

    <ul style="margin-left:2rem">
      <li>Docker & K8s</li>
      <li>Spring Boot</li>
      <li>Kafka with Avro Schemas</li>
      <li>DataDog</li>
      <li>Kibana</li>
      <li>Jira</li>
      <li>Buildkite and Sonarcube</li>
      <li>Little bit of Cypress</li>
    </ul>

    <br /> <br />

    I also got aquainted with the agile sprint process. 

    <br /><br />

    During my time at Wayfair I got to meet and work with a ton of awesome
    people, some of whom I'm sure I'll keep in touch with. I'm looking forward 
    to my next co-op, as this experience was really great.

    <br /><br />

    This part is for recruiters&mdash;I'm going to talk about my performance at
    the company. While working for Wayfair I got a mid co-op review around the
    90 day mark, and a final review right before I left. Both reviews were
    written by my direct manager who I interacted with daily. The first
    review was fairly positive, however, I had only been there for 90 days, so I
    had only just started to get up to speed, and there were still a ton of
    things to learn.

    <br /><br />
    
    I'll let the final review speak for itself. This is the opening paragraph
    from my manager: 
    <Quote>
      Ben is a full contributor to the SEO Impressions engineering team. He
      quickly onboarded and fully contributed as a member of the squad for the
      majority of his coop. Ben stretched himself beyond just executing on
      tickets to fully leading epics for the team. He is consistently strong in
      his data driven communication and works well cross functionally. At this
      point he is performing way above the expectations of a coop and is
      operating at the level of an L2 engineer on the team. As such I'd strongly
      recommend a return coop offer and would push recruiting to stay in close
      contact with Ben and expedite a full time return process after his
      graduation in 2024.
