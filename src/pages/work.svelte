    <div class="subtitle">Pubmark (2023/01/09 - 2023/07/07)</div>
    I worked for Pubmark as a software engineer. This was a co-op that ran from early
    January to early June, 2023. I was on the Partner Products team, where we developed
    and maintained web services for BookBub partners (authors and publishers). The
    team also maintained their own ads platform.

    <br />

    Some new technologies I worked with while at Pubmark include: <br />

    <ul>
      <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
      <li>Clojure</li>
      <li>Nix</li>
      <li>Snowflake (data warehouse)</li>
      <li>Apache Airflow</li>
      <li>AWS</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    Pubmark was an amazing experience for me, I got exposure to a large new technology
    in Rails, and I got access to some amazing and knowledgable people for questions.
    I feel like I really furthered my skills and knowledge as a developer, I picked
    up some new tools, and improved my workflow greatly.

    <div class="subtitle">Wayfair (2022/01/10 - 2022/06/24)</div>
    I worked at Wayfair as a software engineer. This job was a co-op that ran from
    January 10th to June 24th. I was a part of SEO Pod on the Impressions team. The
    SEO Impressions team at Wayfair solves a lot of different and interesting problems,
    and they do so using a lot of different technologies. This was perfect for me
    as a student that's trying to learn as much as possible. During the 6 months
    that I worked at Wayfair, there was always something new to learn.

    <br />

    Here is a list of technologies that I gained experience with at Wayfair:
    <br />

    <ul>
      <li>Docker & K8s</li>
      <li>Spring Boot</li>
      <li>Kafka with Avro Schemas</li>
      <li>DataDog</li>
      <li>Google Cloud Platform</li>
      <li>Kibana</li>
      <li>Jira</li>
      <li>Buildkite and Sonarcube</li>
      <li>Little bit of Cypress</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    During my time at Wayfair I got to meet and work with a ton of awesome
    people. I got to experience what it's like to work for a large tech company,
    and I learned more than I can really articulate.

    <br /><br />

    This part is for recruiters&mdash;I'm going to talk about my performance at
    the company. While working for Wayfair I got a mid co-op review around the
    90 day mark, and a final review right before I left (after 6 months). Both
    reviews were written by my direct manager who I interacted with daily. The
    first review was fairly positive, however, I had only been there for 90
    days, so I had only just started to get up to speed, and there were still a
    ton of things to learn.

    <br /><br />

    And I'll let the final review speak for itself. This is the opening
    paragraph from my final review at Wayfair.
    <Quote>
      Ben is a full contributor to the SEO Impressions engineering team. He
      quickly on-boarded and fully contributed as a member of the squad for the
      majority of his coop. Ben stretched himself beyond just executing on
      tickets to fully leading epics for the team. He is consistently strong in
      his data driven communication and works well cross functionally. At this
      point he is performing way above the expectations of a coop and is
      operating at the level of an L2 engineer on the team. As such I'd strongly
      recommend a return coop offer and would push recruiting to stay in close
      contact with Ben and expedite a full time return process after his
      graduation in 2024.
