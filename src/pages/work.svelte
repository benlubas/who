    I worked at Wayfair as a software engineer. This job was a co-op that ran from
    December 10th to June 24th. I was a part of SEO Pod on the Impression team. The
    Impressions team at Wayfair solves a lot of different and interesting problems,
    and they do so using a lot of different technologies. This is perfect for me
    &mdash; a student that's trying to learn as much as possible. Over the course
    of the 6 months that I was working at Wayfair, there was always something new
    for me to learn.

    <br />

    Here is a list of things that I gained experience with at Wayfair:

    <ul>
      <li>Docker & K8s</li>
      <li>Spring Boot</li>
      <li>Kafka with Avro Schemas</li>
      <li>DataDog</li>
      <li>Kibana</li>
      <li>Agile sprint process</li>
      <li>Jira</li>
      <li>Buildkite, Sonarcube</li>
      <li>Little bit of Cypress</li>
      <li>
        Working in a massive half spaghetti monolith written in PHP (pain)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <br />
    Really more than anything, I think I learned what it meant to work on a team
    at a large corporation. I was able to get a feel for the structure, and the way
    things operated. At first I felt that a lot of what I was doing was unnecessary,
    and I still think that some of it was, but over time I started to realize the
    importance of having an hour long meeting at the end of every sprint to explain
    the work that we've done to hour business counterparts.

    <br />
    <br />
    During my time at Wayfair I got to meet and work with a ton of awesome people,
    some of whom I'm sure I'll keep in touch with, and others who will most certainly
    become references on my resume. I'm looking forward to my next co-op, as this
    experience was really great.
    <br />
    <br />
    This part is for recruiters&mdash;I'm going to talk about my performance at the
    company. While working for Wayfair I got a midpoint review around the 90 day
    mark, and a final review right before I left. Both reviews were written by my
    direct manager who I interacted with alost daily.
