    I worked at Wayfair as a software engineer. This job was a co-op that ran from
    December 10th to June 24th. I was a part of SEO Pod on the Impression team. The
    Impressions team at Wayfair solves a lot of different and interesting problems,
    and they do so using a lot of different technologies. This is perfect for me
    &mdash; a student that's trying to learn as much as possible. Over the course
    of the 6 months that I was working at Wayfair, there was always something new
    for me to learn.

    <br />

    Here is a list of technologies that I gained experience with at Wayfair:

    <ul style="margin-left:2rem">
      <li>Docker & K8s</li>
      <li>Spring Boot</li>
      <li>Kafka with Avro Schemas</li>
      <li>DataDog</li>
      <li>Kibana</li>
      <li>Jira</li>
      <li>Buildkite and Sonarcube</li>
      <li>Little bit of Cypress</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <br />
    Additionally, I learned what it is like to work on a small team within a large
    corporation. I was able to get a feel for the structure and the way things operated.

    <br /><br />

    Most of what I saw was expected (ie. corporations aren't that great but the
    people there are awesome). But there were some surprising things. I was most
    surprised to see the balancing act between figuring out how long it would
    take to do things and actually doing things. I've always worked on personal
    projects or homework assignments by just jumping in and doing them. If it
    took me a week or a month it didn't really matter, and if I have more than
    one idea at once, I can just work on whatever seems more fun and switch
    between them whenever I want. To me, time spent thinking about how long
    something would take was just time not spent planning or coding or
    researching the way to actually do it.

    <br /><br />

    I some ways. I don't have a choice. I have to go in blind because I don't
    have enough prior knowledge or data to look at in order to estimate how much
    time something will take. But in a business setting, when everyone needs to
    know what is going to get done. And when it will get done. And we need to
    commit to deadlines. And we're working on things that affect millions.
    There's suddenly immense value in taking that extra time to plan, and good
    estimates are incredibly valuable.

    <br />
    <br />

    During my time at Wayfair I got to meet and work with a ton of awesome
    people, some of whom I'm sure I'll keep in touch with, and others who will
    most certainly become references on my resume. I'm looking forward to my
    next co-op, as this experience was really great.

    <br />
    <br />

    This part is for recruiters&mdash;I'm going to talk about my performance at
    the company. While working for Wayfair I got a mid co-op review around the
    90 day mark, and a final review right before I left. Both reviews were
    written by my direct manager who I interacted with alost daily. The first
    review was fairly positive, however, I had only been there for 90 days, so I
    had only just started to get up to speed, and there were still a ton of
    things to learn.

    Final Review:
    <Quote>
      Ben is a full contributor to the SEO Impressions engineering team. He
      quickly onboarded and fully contributed as a member of the squad for the
      majority of his coop. Ben stretched himself beyond just executing on
      tickets to fully leading epics for the team. He is consistently strong in
      his data driven communication and works well cross functionally. At this
      point he is performing way above the expectations of a coop and is
      operating at the level of an L2 engineer on the team. As such I'd strongly
      recommend a return coop offer and would push recruiting to stay in close
      contact with Ben and expedite a full time return process after his
      graduation in 2024.
