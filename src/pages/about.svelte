    Hi, I'm Ben Lubas! I'm currently a student at Northeastern University
    studying computer science. Firstly, welcome to my website! I hope you
    enjoyed the homepage, I had a ton of fun making it. I'm going to split this
    about page into catagories, so feel free to skip over the parts that you
    don't care about. First up...

    <div class="subtitle">Programming Experience</div>
    Woo, can you tell I'm writing this for employers? I got my start in comuper science
    in high school, where I took two into to web dev courses, APCS A and APCS Princlples
    (which was a capstone course at my school). The first two classes taught the
    basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We learned how to use Bootstrap and JQueary.
    APCS A is boring, I'll skip to Principles. This course has the easiest of easy
    AP curricula I've every seen. Especially for students that have taken APCS A.
    My teacher understood this, and basically used the class time to teach PHP and
    have the students work together as a class to build a website for the school
    to ultimately use.
    <br />
    That class was really enjoyable for me. In it, we made the Disney Trip website.
    You can read more about that on the projects page. Because I liked making that
    website so much, I wanted to learn more... relevant and less painful web dev
    technologies. So I created an independent study in computer science, called it
    Advanced Web Development. The curriculum consisted of a single project, make
    a website that meets some need of someone in the school district. I chose to
    make a polling site, because I wanted to make this is React, and I didn't know
    React. So that was a simpler project for me to tackle.
    <br />
    I taught myself about React and Node and MongoDB over the summer, and built the
    site in more-or-less one semester. I spent a lot of time durring covid finishing
    the site and pollishing it up. Unfortunately, the school didn't let me into their
    server to configure the hosting that was required. Partly because COVID, hopefully
    I can set it up over
