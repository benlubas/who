      Hi, I'm Ben Lubas! I'm currently a student at Northeastern University
      studying computer science. Firstly, welcome to my website! I hope you
      enjoyed the homepage, I had a ton of fun making it. I'm going to split
      this about page into catagories, so feel free to skip over the parts that
      you don't care about. First up...
      <br />
      <div class="subtitle">Programming Experience</div>
      Woo, can you tell I'm writing this for employers? I got my start in comuper
      science in high school, where I took two into to web dev courses, APCS A and
      APCS Princlples (which was a capstone course at my school). The first two classes
      taught the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We learned how to use Bootstrap
      and JQueary. APCS A is boring, I'll skip to Principles. This course has the
      easiest of easy AP curricula I've every seen. Especially for students that
      have taken APCS A. My teacher understood this, and basically used the class
      time to teach PHP and have the students work together as a class to build a
      website for the school to ultimately use.
      <br />
      That class was really enjoyable for me. In it, we made the Disney Trip website.
      You can read more about that on the projects page. Because I liked making that
      website so much, I wanted to learn more... relevant and less painful web dev
      technologies. So I created an independent study in computer science, called
      it Advanced Web Development. The curriculum consisted of a single project,
      make a website that meets some need of someone in the school district. I chose
      to make a polling site, because I wanted to make this is React, and I didn't
      know React. So that was a simpler project for me to tackle.
      <br />
      I taught myself about React and Node and MongoDB over the summer, and built
      the site in more-or-less one semester. I spent a lot of time durring covid
      finishing the site and pollishing it up. Unfortunately, the school didn't let
      me into their server to configure the hosting that was required. Partly because
      COVID, hopefully I can set it up over the summer at some point.

      <br />
      <div class="subtitle">This Website and Svelte</div>
      This site is built with Svelte, a web framework that's a little differnt. It
      works differently to React in that it's a compiler for JS, it doens't use a
      virtual DOM. This has advantages; it's smaller for small projects, it's easier
      to write in (in my opinion at least), it can do some "magic" that React just
      can't. But it also has the disadvantage that it doesn't scale as well (in addition
      to not having the corporate backing or large community of React).
      <br />
      I ran into Svelte when v 3.0 was launched, and started to learn it. I had already
      used React, but I liked this much better. There's something about the way Svelte
      components are written, they make more sense, they're cleaner.

      <br />
      <div class="subtitle">Education</div>
      I graduated from high school in 2020 (COVID woo), I was around the top of my
      class. I had a 4.958 weighted GPA, took a bunch of AP classes, and was the
      assitant captain of the Varsity Ice Hockey team. I high school I took two intoductory
      CS courses, CS1 & CS2. These introduced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The thing
      that drew me in was the feeling of creating something. Typing some words and
      number on a screen to create a real website was just so cool, and it still
      is. I learned about JS canvas, and we made a few simple games. From there I
      took APCS A, which was very much a break in the magic. Java was much more structured,
      and the limited output in the console was not nearly as cool as creating an
      entire website as I had done before. I still enjoyed the course, and I got
      a 5. But I couldn't wait to get back to websites.
      <br />
      The next year I took my high school's capstone CS course, in which students
      created a website that filled a need within the school. We created the Disney
      Trip site, which you can read more about on the projects page. The year after
      that (b/c I was still a junior at that point), I did the same thing independantly,
      in React. That project is also on the projects page, here.

      <br />

      Okay, so I'm currently in college at Northeastern. I'm a CS major,
      graduating in 2024 (assuming that nothing crazy happens). I'm not planning
      on getting a Masters&mdash;I don't see it as being very valuable, or cost
      effective at this time. I'll go over my coursework on another page, maybe
      I'll remember to link that hopefully. But quickly, Northeastern has a very
      'focused' curriculum. That is to say, I take a lot of CS and CS adjacent
      courses, and not very many extra courses. Don't get me wrong, I have my
      share of history and writting, but the majority of my coursework is in the
      CS field. That's one of the reasons that I really like this school.

      <br />

      In addition to that, I have the co-op experience coming up (this is the
      reason that I'm making this website in the first place!). I'm really
      excited to go on co-op, I'm also a little nervous for interviews, but I'll
      get through it. I'm extreamely gratefull that Northeastern has the co-op
      program.
