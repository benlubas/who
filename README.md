# Who?

This is always a work in progress, I try to update it as often as possible.

Who is Ben Lubas? In theory, you don't know and that's what this site is here for.

## Development

This is a svelte project, all of the text is just hard coded and statically served, so nothing fancy
there.

So install npm deps: `npm install`
And then you're off to races.

To run the server locally:
- `npm run dev`

To build the project:
- `npm run build`
